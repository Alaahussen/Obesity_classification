#Obesity_classification
# 🧠 Obesity Risk Classification Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify the **obesity risk level** of individuals based on various personal and behavioral features such as eating habits, physical activity, age, weight, and transportation mode.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes health and lifestyle information of individuals from **Mexico**, **Peru**, and **Colombia**, aged between **14 and 61**. It is sourced from [Kaggle - Obesity or CVD Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster).

### 📌 Features include:
- Age, Gender, Height, Weight
- Eating habits and frequency
- Water and alcohol consumption
- Physical activity
- Time spent on technology
- Mode of transportation
- Smoking habits
- Family history of overweight
- **Target**: `NObeyesdad` (Obesity level classification)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Perform **feature engineering** and **visualization**.
- Apply various **classification algorithms**.
- Compare model performance to select the best approach.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
4. **Performance Comparison**
5. **Final Model Selection**

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Classification models like **Random Forest**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Logistic Regression**, etc. are used. Models are evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
